---

## ‚úÖ Critical Issues Resolved (Priority 0)

### ‚úÖ Admin API Endpoints in Netlify Function
**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
- The Netlify serverless function (`netlify/functions/server/server.js`) has all required admin PATCH endpoints
- Available endpoints include:
  - ‚úÖ `PATCH /api/orders/:id` (order updates)
  - ‚úÖ `PATCH /api/orders/:id/status` (status updates)
  - ‚úÖ `PATCH /api/batches/:id` (batch updates)
  - ‚úÖ `PATCH /api/users/:id` (user updates)

### ‚úÖ Frontend File Upload Connected to Backend
**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**  
- The `FileUpload` component auto-uploads files to `/api/files/upload` when added
- Files are properly uploaded to Netlify Blobs with metadata stored in database
- `SubmitPrint` component correctly handles uploaded file metadata and prevents submission until uploads complete

---

## ‚úÖ Priority 1: Complete Netlify Blobs File Upload Integration

### ‚úÖ 1.1. Frontend Implementation (`SubmitPrint.tsx`) 

-   **Objective:** Connect the file upload component to the backend API and associate uploaded files with a print request.
-   **Tasks:**
    1.  ‚úÖ **Create a File Upload API Service:** Backend endpoint `/api/files/upload` exists and is functional
    2.  ‚úÖ **Integrate with `FileUpload` Component:** The `FileUpload` component auto-uploads files when added via the `uploadFile` function
    3.  ‚úÖ **Manage Upload State:**
        -   ‚úÖ Track the upload progress for each file (uploading, completed, error)
        -   ‚úÖ Display progress indicators and error messages within the `FileUpload` component
    4.  ‚úÖ **Store Uploaded File Metadata:** File metadata including `uploadedFileId` is stored in component state
    5.  ‚úÖ **Modify Order Submission:** `SubmitPrint` includes uploaded file metadata in the payload sent to `/api/orders` and prevents submission until uploads complete

### 1.2. Backend Implementation (API Routes & Services) ‚úÖ

-   **Objective:** Create the necessary API endpoints to handle file uploads and link them to orders.
-   **Tasks:**
    1.  ‚úÖ **Create File Upload Endpoint:**
        -   ‚úÖ Implement a new `POST /api/files/upload` route.
        -   ‚úÖ Use `multer` to process `multipart/form-data` requests and handle the file stream in memory.
        -   ‚úÖ In the route handler, use the `netlifyBlobsService` to upload the file buffer to Netlify Blobs.
        -   ‚úÖ After a successful upload, store the file's metadata in the `files` table using the `FilesRepository`.
        -   ‚úÖ Return the newly created file metadata to the client.
    2.  ‚úÖ **Update Order Creation Logic:**
        -   ‚úÖ Modify the `POST /api/orders` endpoint to accept an array of file IDs in its request body.
        -   ‚úÖ When a new order is created, associate the provided file IDs with the order by updating the `files` JSONB column in the `orders` table.

### 1.3. File Viewing and Downloading ‚úÖ

-   **Objective:** Ensure users can view and download files associated with their orders.
-   **Tasks:**
    1.  ‚úÖ **Verify `OrderDetailsDialog.tsx`:** The dialog correctly fetches and displays the list of files from the order's `files` array.
    2.  ‚úÖ **Implement Secure Downloads:**
        -   ‚úÖ Download links in the dialog point to the correct backend endpoint (`/api/files/:id/download`).
        -   ‚úÖ The backend route includes permission checks to ensure only the order owner or an admin can download the file.
        -   ‚úÖ The route fetches the file from Netlify Blobs and streams it back to the user with the correct `Content-Disposition` and `Content-Type` headers.

---

## ‚ùå Priority 2: Notification System

-   **Objective:** Implement email notifications for key order status changes.

### ‚ùå 2.1. Backend Notification Service

-   **Tasks:**
    1.  ‚ùå **Choose & Configure a Service:** Integrate an email-sending service like **Nodemailer** or a third-party provider (e.g., SendGrid, Resend).
    2.  ‚ùå **Create a `NotificationService`:** Develop a service class that abstracts the logic for sending different types of emails (e.g., `sendOrderStatusUpdate`, `sendPrintFailureAlert`).
    3.  ‚ùå **Integrate with Order Logic:** In the `OrdersRepository` or a higher-level service, call the `NotificationService` whenever an order's status is updated (e.g., `APPROVED`, `STARTED`, `FINISHED`, `FAILED`).
    4.  ‚ùå **Develop Email Templates:** Create simple, clear HTML email templates for each notification type.

### ‚ùå 2.2. User Preferences

-   **Tasks:**
    1.  ‚ùå **Implement API Endpoints:** Create `GET` and `PUT` endpoints for `/api/user/notification-preferences` to allow users to manage their settings.
    2.  ‚ùå **Build Frontend UI:** Add a section in the user's profile or a new settings page where they can toggle different notification types on or off.
    3.  ‚ùå **Update Notification Service:** The `NotificationService` must check a user's preferences before sending an email.

---

## ‚ùå Priority 3: Advanced Analytics & Reporting

-   **Objective:** Expand the dashboard capabilities to provide deeper insights into printing operations.

### ‚ùå 3.1. Backend Data Aggregation

-   **Tasks:**
    1.  ‚ùå **Develop Advanced SQL Queries:** Create new functions in the repositories to aggregate data for:
        -   Material and color usage statistics.
        -   Print success/failure rates per club or user.
        -   Average print times and queue wait times.
    2.  ‚ùå **Create New API Endpoints:** Expose this aggregated data through new endpoints (e.g., `/api/stats/materials`, `/api/stats/printer-usage`).

### ‚ùå 3.2. Frontend Visualization

-   **Tasks:**
    1.  ‚ùå **Integrate Charts:** Use the existing `recharts` library to add new charts and graphs to the `AdminDashboard` and `SuperAdminDashboard` pages.
    2.  ‚ùå **Build Analytics Components:** Create new reusable components for displaying key metrics, data tables, and reports.
    3.  ‚ùå **Implement Report Export:** Add a feature to allow admins to export analytics data as a CSV file.

---

## ‚è≥ Priority 4: Automated File Cleanup

-   **Objective:** Implement a scheduled task to automatically delete expired files from Netlify Blobs.

### ‚è≥ 4.1. Create a Scheduled Function

-   **Tasks:**
    1.  ‚ùå **Define a Netlify Scheduled Function:** Configure a function in `netlify.toml` to run on a schedule (e.g., daily at midnight).
    2.  ‚úÖ **Implement Cleanup Logic:** The `filesRepository.cleanupExpiredFiles()` method exists and can:
        -   ‚úÖ List all blobs in the store.
        -   ‚úÖ For each blob, check its `expiresAt` metadata.
        -   ‚úÖ If the file is expired, delete it from the blob store and remove its reference from the corresponding order in the database.

---

## ‚è≥ Priority 5: UI/UX Polish & Refinements (Ongoing)

-   **Objective:** Improve the overall user experience and application stability.

### ‚è≥ 5.1. Frontend Enhancements

-   **Tasks:**
    1.  ‚è≥ **Granular Loading States:** Add more specific loading indicators (e.g., skeleton loaders for tables and cards) to reduce perceived wait times.
    2.  ‚è≥ **Improved Error Handling:** Provide more user-friendly and context-specific error messages for API failures.
    3.  ‚ùå **Accessibility Audit:** Review the application for accessibility issues (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen reader support, color contrast) and implement fixes.
    4.  ‚ùå **User Profile Page:** Create a dedicated page where users can view their profile information and manage settings.
