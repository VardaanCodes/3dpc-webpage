# Implementation Progress Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. **Database Schema and Migration Setup**

   - Created Drizzle ORM schema in `shared/schema.ts`
   - Set up migration scripts in `scripts/migrate-db.ts` and `scripts/generate-migrations.ts`
   - Generated initial migration files

2. **Repository Pattern Implementation**

   - Implemented repositories for users, orders, clubs, batches, audit logs, system config, and files
   - Created a storage interface in `server/types/storage.ts`
   - Implemented PostgreSQL storage with `PostgresStorage` class

3. **Netlify Blobs Integration**

   - Created `FilesRepository` with Netlify Blobs integration
   - Implemented file upload, download, listing, and cleanup functionality
   - Updated the files API routes to use the repository

4. **Documentation**
   - Created `NETLIFY_NEON_INTEGRATION.md` for Neon database setup
   - Created `REPOSITORY_PATTERN_GUIDE.md` for repository pattern usage
   - Created `NETLIFY_BLOBS_GUIDE.md` for Netlify Blobs integration
   - Created `IMPLEMENTATION_UPDATE_PLAN.md` for next steps

## In Progress

1. **Storage Implementation Update**

   - Updated to use `PostgresStorage` implementation of `IStorage` interface
   - Added necessary methods to the interface

2. **API Route Refactoring**
   - Refactored file upload/download routes to use `FilesRepository`
   - Need to update other API routes to use the new storage implementation

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**

   - Create a test database on Neon for development
   - Run migrations against the Neon database
   - Test all API endpoints with the new implementation

2. **Deployment**

   - Install Netlify Neon extension in Netlify dashboard
   - Set up environment variables in Netlify
   - Deploy to Netlify and verify functionality

3. **Frontend Integration**
   - Update frontend to use the new API endpoints
   - Test file upload/download functionality

## Notes

- The application is currently in a hybrid state, using both Firebase Authentication and Netlify/Neon for database
- We can run database migrations using Neon's serverless driver without a local PostgreSQL instance
- The `FilesRepository` uses Netlify Blobs for file storage and PostgreSQL for metadata

## Technical Debt

- Some type issues need to be resolved in the repositories
- Need to implement proper error handling in all repositories
- Add unit and integration tests for repositories
- Complete the transition from Firebase Firestore to PostgreSQL
